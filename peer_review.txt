Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?
They are! No README though. Small project. Probably not necessary.

Is the code easy to read (good indentation, spacing, naming)?
Lacking 4 space indentation. Otherwise everything looks good.

Were branching and looping used effectively?
Yes.

Is the web page(s) styled using Bootstrap and CSS?
Styled with Bootstrap. No CSS for this project.

Is the site user-friendly?
Strange semi-colons on form labels. Check .html file for comments.

Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?
You guys are awesome!
